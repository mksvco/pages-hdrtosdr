                    HDR→SDR is built on a simple principle: your footage is yours. We don't want it, we don't need it, and we definitely don't collect it.

                    <h3 class="feature-title">100% Local Processing</h3>
                    <p class="feature-description">
                        Everything happens on your Mac. Your videos are processed locally using Apple's AVFoundation framework. Nothing is uploaded to the cloud. Nothing is sent to our servers. Nothing leaves your device. Ever.
                    </p>

                    <h3 class="feature-title">No Data Collection</h3>
                    <p class="feature-description">
                        We don't collect your data. We don't track your usage. We don't have analytics. We don't know what files you're converting, how many, or when. We don't care. Your business is your business.
                    </p>

                    <h3 class="feature-title">No Internet Required</h3>
                    <p class="feature-description">
                        HDR→SDR works completely offline. Once you download it, you never need an internet connection to use it. No phoning home. No updates checking. No telemetry. Just you and your videos.
                    </p>

                    <h3 class="feature-title">No Third-Party Services</h3>
                    <p class="feature-description">
                        We don't use third-party analytics services. We don't use crash reporting services. We don't use any services that might collect your data. The app is self-contained and private.
                    </p>

                    <h3 class="feature-title">That's It</h3>
                    <p class="feature-description">
                        There's no fine print. No hidden clauses. No data sharing agreements. Your videos stay on your Mac. Period.
